### `CadenceAI`: Your all-in-one AI-powered cycling coach, mechanic, analyst and dietitian üö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§ñÔ∏èüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇ
Did you know there are over 1 billion bicycles in the world? The cycling industry is entirely commoditised.
However, **helpful** and **personalised** advice on training, repair and nutrition is out of reach for most people. 

Introducing - `Cadence AI`, your all-in-one AI-powered cycling coach, mechanic, analyst and dietitian.
